# Analyze-of-scRNA-seq

For project 4 for the class. This project was done with 2 other members of the team reposited in BioByte repository_branch. I am adding here the part that I created. 

For this data I analyzed datasets deposited in GEO repository (GSE139495, published 2020).

data source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE139495
             https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32822091/

Since dataset were heavy and taking time to initilize the code from the resuming, I created 2 notebooks: 
    1. EDA/quality control pass/ merging final dataset for further analyses. 
    2. scRNA sequening analysis. 

Datasets are too heavy to upload to github repository, please refer to the original site for your references. 

Lesson to learn: 

Since scRNA seq data is rich of the values to close to 0, first think I should have done was inputing data. I learned harmonypy library to input data, next time I will try to analyze after inputing. 

Thank you,
